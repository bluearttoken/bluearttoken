Re mintable feature: Removed from contract, technically impossible Smart Contract : [0x81Aa4d3AD2A86E7A2cd44630C36ccAACD6b30568 ](https://bscscan.com/address/0x81Aa4d3AD2A86E7A2cd44630C36ccAACD6b30568)

BlueArt  Token  (BLA);  It  is  the  official  cryptocurrency  of  the  currently active [BlueArt.IO ](https://blueart.io/)NFT Marketplace and the BlueArt Metaverse, which will be available on the Scheduled date. 

Our team has foreseen the following objectives while planning the development of $BLA; 

- Recognition  as  a  trusted  currency  on  art-based  digital  platforms  (Primarily BlueArt.IO) 
- Using as a means of payment in the trade of physical works of art
- Use as a mass money transfer tool with a mobile wallet
- Evaluation as an asset traded on the stock exchanges

It works as a BEP20 token on Binance Smart Chain. It has a maximum supply of 88 million. It works in a deflationary structure. 2% of each transfer is automatically distributed to charities and 3% to wallets holding tokens. Non-routine planned burning will be applied (10%). Increasing the supply of $BLA is technically impossible as this feature has been canceled  in  the  smart  contract.  The  maximum  supply  will  never  increase,  but  will constantly decrease with regular manual burnings. 

Our current roadmap according to LightPaper v1. 

*(Note: Our roadmap will be updated by adding new targets and developments regularly.)*
